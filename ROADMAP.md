# Stroop Test - Product Roadmap

## Feature 1: No-Colour-Fill Button Toggle ✅

Add a toggle that removes the colour background from buttons, leaving only the text label. This forces players to read the word on each button rather than relying on the button colour as a visual cue.

## Feature 2: Difficulty Levels (Easy / Medium / Hard) ✅

Replace individual toggles with three preset difficulty levels that group settings together.

### Easy

- Colour-filled buttons (background matches label)
- Labels shown on buttons
- No button shuffling
- 10-second starting timer
- Timer reduces by 1s every 10 correct answers (minimum 2s)
- Level "complete" at 100 correct answers (but user can continue for high scores)

### Medium

- Colour-filled buttons
- Labels hidden
- Shuffle buttons every 10 answers
- 8-second starting timer
- Timer reduces by 1s every 10 correct answers (minimum 2s)
- Level "complete" at 100 correct answers (but user can continue for high scores)

### Hard

- No colour fill on buttons (plain/neutral background)
- Labels shown (text only, no colour cue)
- Shuffle button order after every correct answer
- 6-second starting timer
- Timer reduces by 1s every 10 correct answers (minimum 1s)
- Level "complete" at 100 correct answers (but user can continue for high scores)

### Custom (optional)

- Allow manual toggle configuration for players who want to mix and match settings outside the presets

## Feature 3: UI Improvements

- Left-align toggle options on the start screen for visual clarity

## Feature 4: Audio Response Mode

Add a mode where the player's microphone is the only input method. The player must say the colour name out loud instead of clicking a button. Uses the Web Speech Recognition API to capture and evaluate spoken answers in real time.

### Considerations

- Browser support (Web Speech API is primarily Chrome/Edge)
- Microphone permission handling and clear UI feedback
- Tolerance for accent/pronunciation variation
- Visual feedback when speech is detected vs recognised
- Fallback or error messaging for unsupported browsers
- May need a short cooldown between rounds to avoid picking up residual audio

## Feature 5: Extra Colours ✅

Add option to increase the number of colours from 5 up to 10 in Custom mode. Additional colours: orange, pink, purple, cyan, brown.

## Next feature: Start time slider - DONE

On start page, let users select a starting max response time, with 10s down to 2 sec and show that as a extremely difficult.

## Feature 6: Language Selection - Partially Complete

Add a toggle or dropdown to switch the game language. Colour words and button labels will display in the selected language, adding an extra cognitive challenge for multilingual players or language learners.

## Feature 7: Increasing difficulty levels

Add a fractional time reduction after user hits the minimum time limit - reduce down by 0.2 seconds each 10 correct answers, making it eventually impossible. At 0.2 seconds, after 10, tell the user they win - only way to improve is by improving response time.

## Feature 8: Leaderboard

Ask user to input their name for leaderboard, to compete against themselves at this point. Tell them if they performed a personal best after subsequent runs, or what their goal is if not.

## Feature 9: Use clear, distinct colours. 

Use brown instead of cyan. Use pink over purple. Remove purple.

## Feature 10: Put answer buttons in a few columns.

Make the answer buttons in a few columns - dont let them fill the width of a wide screen, they should be closer to centre, so 3 x 3 block if 9 colours.

## Next Feature: Make time slider brighter colour.

Make time slider colour more prominent as it is currently hard to see 

## Feature: Voice mode - ignore invalid answers

If word is not recognised, show a warning saying "Colour not recgonised!" and continue, allowing next input

## Feature: Fix voice mode toggle logic in custom

Some custom toggles should adjust to read-only if voice mode is active

## Bug fix: voice input for Spanish should not stop after 1 entry

Currently, Spanish version stops after 1st correct voice answer - this should not happen. Check other languages for this, too.

## Bug fix: voice input for Welsh does not work

It allows inputs but none are correct - is there even a Welsh speech-to-text engine to verify this? If not, remove the audio option when Welsh is selected.

## Bug fix: voice input on desktop browser should work
It works on mobile browser but not desktop - why? Fix it please or prove it is a local issue.

### Supported Languages

- English (default)
- Welsh (Cymraeg)

### Considerations

- Language selector on start screen (dropdown or button group)
- Persist language choice in localStorage
- Update voice recognition language code when using audio mode (e.g., `es-ES`, `fr-FR`)
- Consider adding voice aliases for each language to handle pronunciation variations
